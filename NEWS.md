# Version 0.2.99.9000

# Version 0.2.1

* Update to fix outstanding R CMD check issues.

# Version 0.2 (2010-11-11)

## New features

* Memoised functions now have an attribute memoised=TRUE, and
  is.memoised() tests whether a function is memoised. (Contributed by
  Sietse Brouwer.)

## Improvements

* Documentation is now more elaborate, and hopefully more accessible to
  newcomers. Thanks to Sietse Brouwer for the verbosity.
